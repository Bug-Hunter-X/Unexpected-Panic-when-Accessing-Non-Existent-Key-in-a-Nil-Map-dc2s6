This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Go programming: panics caused by accessing non-existent keys in nil maps.  The `bug.go` file shows the erroneous code, which panics because it attempts to access an element in a nil map. The `bugSolution.go` file illustrates how to safely handle this situation, avoiding unexpected panics and ensuring more robust code.
